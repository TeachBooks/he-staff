**English summary**
_______________________
**The HE MT has decided the following regarding the reimbursement of stolen personal and departmental items within the CEG faculty:**

The department offers a one-time reimbursement for stolen personal items with a value of up to €250 that were stolen during the summer of 2024, provided that the following conditions are met:

1. The staff member can provide an invoice for the stolen item.
2. A report of the theft has been filed with the police.
   
The department provides secure storage facilities for staff members to store personal and departmental items. This includes, among other things, the use of lockable cabinets within the department’s rooms.

After this communication, the department will no longer offer reimbursement for stolen personal belongings unless they were stored in a secured area. 

It is the responsibility of the owner to store items safely.
Departmental items, such as laptops or other equipment provided by the department, remain the responsibility of the department itself. These items will, if necessary, be reimbursed according to the standard departmental procedure for damage or loss, regardless of whether they were stored in a secured area.
