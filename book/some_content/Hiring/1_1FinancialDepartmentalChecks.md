## 1.1 Check finances and send to department secretary 

First of all, there are two checks: 

* The financial check. If the vacancy is part of a project (2nd/3rd cashflow), the internal budget has to be checked. If the vacancy has a 1st cashflow, contact the Business Controller David Lodowica for the financial check. 
* The departmental check. Inform the department secretary and your section head about the vacancy you want to post. 

If both checks are complete, you can continue with the next step.
