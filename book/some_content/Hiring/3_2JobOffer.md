## 3.2 Job offer 

When you have selected your preferred candidate and the Knowledge Safety Check is positive, you can inform the candidate and send a job offer. Make sure you do not reject your second-best or silver candidate(s) before the job offer is signed.  

First, you call the candidate with the good news. Collect the following details before calling the candidate: 

* Details about the contract, such as duration, starting date, salary, working hours and contact details for follow-up questions. You can revisit the Vacancy Format for details and contact the HR advisor if you have any questions regarding this. Planning the first workday in a holiday period is not preferred, but if you choose to do so please ensure someone will be there for the new employee during the first week. 

* Check the English proficiency level (ETV). At this stage, it is highly recommended to have either a good test result, an English masters degree or a native status by nationality. See also

* If you are hiring an international candidate, provide the URL of the website of the Coming to Delft department and a brief introduction of their services.  

* If you are hiring a PhD, include a brief introduction to the Graduate School and the mentor programme. 

* Gather information about the next steps of the process: the job offer, the contract, the first workday. Preferably, you also provide the candidate with a time indication of the next steps. 

Next, you contact the management assistant for the job offer. The management assistant will make the job offer based on the information you provide: duration, starting date, salary, working hours, english proficiency (ETV) and contact details. The management assistant will send the job offer to the candidate with you in the cc. 

Update Talentlink. When the job offer is accepted and all other candidates are rejected, contact the management assistant to close the vacancy in Talentlink.
