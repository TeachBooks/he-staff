## 4.3 First workday 

Congratulations, the new candidate will soon arrive! Think about the welcome you give: How will their first workday and workweek look like? Make sure to make a round introducing people and please do visit the management assistants.  

In the first week you also plan a meeting 2 weeks before the end of the trial period to review their performance. This conversation is a good opportunity to let the candidate know what you think. Compliment the candidate on positive points and tell in where you see room for improvement. If the candidate is malfunctioning, contact the HR advisor a few weeks before the end of the trial period. 

And one final comment: you must delete all files of the vacancy process for privacy reasons.
