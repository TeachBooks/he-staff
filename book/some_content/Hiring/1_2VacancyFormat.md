## 1.2 Fill in vacancy format 

Use the vacancy format to gather the required information for the vacancy: [Vacancy Format](../Hiring/Appendices/Vacancy%20Format%201.7%20-%20ENG%20-%20Version%2017-05-2021.docx)

The vacancy text can be written using the [vacancy writing guide](../Hiring/Appendices/Guide%20to%20creating%20recruitment%20text%20for%20scientific%20staff%20-%20Jan%202021.pdf) . As some have noted, the format does not handle comments well, so you can consider making and shaping the vacancy text in a separate word document first. Examples of vacancy texts can be found below.  

Contact the department secretary (for PhD/Post-Doc positions) or the HR advisor (for academic career track/ higher functions) to discuss the UFO profile, the conditions of employment and the vacancy text.  

Further information that will help you filling out the form: 
* The Talent Acquisition Specialist of the faculty is Avital Fishman. 
* The cash flow is 1 for direct employees and 2/3 for project employees. 
* The standard time for a vacancy posting to stay active is 4-6 weeks. Contact Dept-Chair-HE@tudelft.nl if you would like to deviate from this.  
* Please be aware that the visa arrangement and the safety check may take weeks for NON-EU candidates. A reasonable start date will be six months from the moment you start the vacancy process. 


It is good practice to form the selection committee in this step:
* For permanent staff, the department secretary will form the selection committee as there are many rules for those committees.  
* In case of a PhD and Postdoc positions, we use the 4-eye principle in the selection steps, meaning you select together with at least one other person. This is done to avoid biased decisions and blind spots. Try to include a senior staff member and someone neutral, who doesnâ€™t have a vested interest in the hire.
