## 3.1 Selection steps 

The main steps of the selection process are  

* The CV check. In this step you reject the candidate who miss must-haves. You also comment on the other candidates. If no promising candidates have applied, contact the talent acquisition specialist or the HR advisor. 

* Screening interviews. A screening by short phone or video calls may be a good in-between step before the job interviews. 

* The full interviews. Here you check the social and scientific fit of the candidates. 

* Choosing a candidate. In this stage you choose the preferred candidate. In this stage you rate candidates based on the criteria you defined, and you make reference calls. 


A great guide for these steps can be found in chapter 3 of this document:

Some important notes: 

* About the job interviews: 

  * The management assistants can help you planning the interviews.  
  * Below you can find some general outlines for job interviews.  
  * Candidates for the permanent staff can come to the Netherlands for full job interviews, contact the department secretary for information about the travel allowance, etc 

* Be aware of the knowledge safety check! [LINK SAFETY CHECK] It is wise to start the knowledge safety check as soon as you have a shortlist of the 3-4 best candidates. Students from or with connections to China, Russia, Belarus, Iran and North Korea should be checked. How to do it? 

  * Send an email to HR with the candidate's name(s) and the number of the vacancy.  
  * They will communicate with the safety knowledge department, and they will inform you about the outcome as soon as they have the result.  
  * This check takes approximately 2 weeks and may in extreme cases take up to 10 weeks. 
  * Do not inform the candidates about the knowledge safety check as this information is confidential. 

* Check the English proficiency level (ETV) of the candidates. An additional test is needed if PhD candidates are non-native speakers and have not followed their masters in English, see:

For other scientific staff, see: 
<!-- https://intranet.tudelft.nl/en/-/itav-english-language-skills?p_l_back_url=%2Fen%2Fgroup%2Fguest%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Detv   -->


* Be aware that the process may take longer depending on the nationality of the candidate. The knowledge safety check and acquiring visa may both take several weeks to months.
