## 3.1 Selection steps 

The main steps of the selection process are:

1. The CV check. In this step you reject the candidate who miss must-haves. You also comment on the other candidates. If no promising candidates have applied, contact the talent acquisition specialist or the HR advisor. 

2. Screening interviews. A screening by short phone or video calls may be a good in-between step before the job interviews. 

3. The full interviews. Here you check the social and scientific fit of the candidates. 

4. Choosing a candidate. In this stage you choose the preferred candidate. In this stage you rate candidates based on the criteria you defined, and you make reference calls. 


A great guide for these steps can be found in chapter 3 of [this document](../Hiring/Appendices/PhD%20Recruitment%20en%20Selection%20Guide%20V1.pdf). Although this document is written for PhD hiring, it is also very helpful for other functions. 



Some important notes: 
* The selection process is done using **Talentlink**. Instructions can be found in a [series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbWrpIaE6Ac&list=PLvaU1SY38TUVKbhgaSeaaKQhWeHsRUDiZ&index=1)
and in [quick reference charts](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/en/group/guest/-/recruitmentsysteem). Use this system as much as possible and do not store or send cv's by mail. 

* About the **job interviews**: 

  * The management assistants can help you planning the interviews.  
  * General outlines for job interviews are available for [educational](../Hiring/Appendices/JobInterview_HelpingFiles/SPV%20Education%20Questionaire%20-%2020221220.%20-final.docx), [leadership](../Hiring/Appendices/JobInterview_HelpingFiles/SPV%20Leadership%20questionaire%2020221220%20-%20final.docxSPV%20Education%20Questionaire%20-%2020221220.%20-final.docx) and [research](../Hiring/Appendices/JobInterview_HelpingFiles/SPV%20Research%20Questionaire%2020221220%20-%20final.docx) functions.  
  * Candidates for the permanent staff can come to the Netherlands for full job interviews, contact the department secretary for information about the travel allowance, etc 

<!-- Can add a link to the safety check in this section if that page is ready -->
* Be aware of the **knowledge safety check**! It is wise to start the knowledge safety check as soon as you have a shortlist of the 3-4 best candidates. Students from or with connections to China, Russia, Belarus, Iran and North Korea should be checked. How to do it? 

  * Send an email to HR with the candidate(s) name(s) to be checked and the number of the vacancy.  
  * HR will communicate with the safety knowledge department. HR will inform you about the outcome as soon as they have the result.  
  * This check takes approximately 2 weeks and may in extreme cases take up to 10 weeks. 
  * Do not inform the candidates about the knowledge safety check as this information is confidential. 

* Check the **English proficiency level (ETV)** of the candidates. An additional test is needed if PhD candidates are non-native speakers and have not followed their masters in English, see [this intranet page](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/en/-/english-language-skills-etv-for-phd-candidates?p_l_back_url=%2Fen%2Fgroup%2Fguest%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Detv) for PhD's and [this intranet page](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/en/-/itav-english-language-skills?p_l_back_url=%2Fen%2Fgroup%2Fguest%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Detv) for other scientific staff.


* Be aware that the process may take longer depending on the nationality of the candidate. The knowledge safety check usually takes 2 weeks and in extreme cases 10 weeks. Acquiring visa usually takes ~4 weeks for EU citizens and 12 weeks for non-EU citizens.
