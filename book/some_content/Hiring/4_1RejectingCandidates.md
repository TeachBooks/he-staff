## 4.1 Reject candidates 

Once your preferred candidate has accepted the job offer, it’s time to reject your 2nd best or silver candidate(s). Rejecting candidates after the interview stage is preferably done by phone or face-to-face. This is the responsibility of the vacancy holder and not an easy task. These candidates invested time and energy in the application process and must be treated with respect and care. Furthermore, keep in mind that every interaction with a candidate can either harm or improve TU Delft’s employer brand and that of your research department.  

Do not mention the knowledge safety check in your rejection conversation. The outcome of the knowledge safety check may not be shared with the candidates. Instead, you can mention that other candidates were more suitable for this position. 

#### Tips for rejection conversations 

When delivering bad news, please ensure you:  

* Do not postpone it. Get it done before the weekend whenever possible. The candidate will be expecting a follow-up and will feel disappointed if they haven’t heard from you. These candidates will share a bad experience with their peers. This could harm your reputation as an employer within the highly specific network you both operate in.  

* Be as clear as possible. A clear selection strategy will help you to explain why the candidate was not selected for the position. Vague and general feedback like “the other candidate performed better in the interview” or “the other candidate has more relevant experience” can stir strong negative emotions. 

* Stick to sharing actual observations and refrain from definitive conclusions about a candidate’s abilities. You don’t know a candidate’s true potential. Nevertheless, you do have to make a decision based on the impressions collected during the selection process. Don’t say “Your presentation skills are insufficient”. Do say: “During your presentation to the group we saw you struggling to answer questions. In addition, 4 out of the 5 people in the audience, couldn’t reproduce the core of your message.” 

* More guidelines on delivering bad news in a positive way:  

    1. Start with the announcement: “Hello Tristan, I am calling about your application to the position of PhD candidate. Is this a good time to talk?”  

    2. Share the message. Be clear, factual and concise. This will reduce the likelihood of a candidate experiencing anger. For example: “Unfortunately, I have bad news. We have decided not to make you an offer for this position. The main reason is…..”  

    3. Pause and listen. You may also ask the candidate “How does this makes you feel?” Don’t guess how the candidate feels. When an emotion is shared or visible, acknowledge it. “I can hear that you are disappointed/upset and I understand”.    

    4. If a candidate feels sad or disappointed, this is a healthy part of the process of letting expectations go. Allow space for the candidate to regain their balance. Don’t disempower the candidate by feeling sorry for them.   

    5. If a candidate feels angry, don’t take anything personally. Stay calm. Anger can be beneficial for the candidate, too. Don’t try to explain your reasoning during the peak of an emotion. Let the candidate know that you understand their reaction and allow them time to process. If a candidate is very upset, guard your boundaries. In this case, you can kindly end the conversation by stating that you will be in touch again the next day to answer any remaining questions. Always follow up on your promise.  

    6. Once the peak of the emotion has passed, again offer your fact-based explanation and answer any questions. Don’t alter your initial explanation. Acknowledge any emotions. Sometimes, you will have to repeat your answer several times.
