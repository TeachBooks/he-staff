## 4.2 Contract and other administrative tasks 

In this phase between the job offer and the first workday, the management assistants play a significant role. They will manage the MyHR process, send foreign students information about housing, sign up the candidate for the graduate school (if PhD) and arrange a laptop and workplace. 

**MyHR and the contract**

The management assistant follows the workflow in MyHR. MyHR is used to gather the candidate's information and the contract information. It contains steps to obtain approval from several persons. In the end, a contract is made and signed by the candidate. 

Contact the management assistant to start up the MyHR process. They will need information about the candidate in two stages. First, they need the following information about the candidate: 
- Initials of first names 
- First names 
- Preferred name (in Dutch: roepnaam) 
- Prefix (e.g. van or de) 
- Last name 
- Gender 
- Date of birth 
- Phone number private 
- E-mail private 
- Organisatorical unit (i.e. name of section or department) 
- Has this person been employed at TU Delft before? 

The next step is about the contract details. Discuss the following questions with the candidate and give the outcomes to the management assistant: 
- On which days will the candidate work? 
- On which days is the candidate on campus? Note that the TU Delft policy is to work at least 60% of the time on campus. 
- Enable payroll tax credit (‘loonheffingskorting’)?  
- Does the candidate want the plus or minus variant? More information can be found on [intranet](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/en/-/flexible-working-time) and an overview of the possibilities is given in a [table](../Hiring/Appendices/Appendix%20Table%20Flexible%20Working%20Hours%20and%20Times%20(1).pdf)


The management assistant can also ask other questions regarding the contract details during this stage. Also inform the management assistant if the contract dates have changed since the job offer. The management assistant will also contact the department secretary and HR advisor to check the contract details. 

If you have not heard of the MyHR process for more than a week, you can go to the management assistant to check where the process is currently stuck. They can see at which step action is required and by whom. Contact the person responsible for the current step to continue the process. 

**When the contract is signed**

When the contract has been signed, the candidate can apply for a visa. A working permit for EU candidates usually takes ~4 weeks. A residence permit for non-EU candidates usually takes 12 weeks.  

The candidate will automatically get emails for their NetID and campus card.
