## 4.1 Contract and other administrative tasks 

In this phase between the job offer and the first workday, the management assistants play a significant role. They will manage the MyHR process, send foreign students information about housing, sign up the candidate for the graduate school (if PhD) and arrange a laptop and workplace. 

**MyHR and the contract**

The management assistant follows the workflow in MyHR. MyHR is used to gather the candidate's information and the contract information. It contains steps to obtain approval from several persons. In the end, a contract is made and signed by the candidate. 

Contact the management assistant to start up the MyHR process. They will need information about the candidate in two stages. 

```{admonition} What information is required for the first stage of MyHR?
:class: info, dropdown

- Initials of first names 
- First names 
- Preferred name (in Dutch: roepnaam) 
- Prefix (e.g. van or de) 
- Last name 
- Gender 
- Date of birth 
- Phone number private 
- E-mail private 
- Organisatorical unit (i.e. name of section or department) 
- Has this person been employed at TU Delft before? 
```

The second step is about the contract details. Discuss the questions with the candidate and give the outcomes to the management assistant

```{admonition} What information is required for the second stage of MyHR?
:class: info, dropdown

- On which days will the candidate work? 
- On which days is the candidate on campus? Note that the TU Delft policy is to work at least 60% of the time on campus. 
- Enable payroll tax credit (‘loonheffingskorting’)?  
- Does the candidate want the plus or minus variant? More information can be found on [intranet](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/en/-/flexible-working-time) and an overview of the possibilities is given in a [table](../PhDPostDocs/Appendices/Appendix%20Table%20Flexible%20Working%20Hours%20and%20Times%20(1).pdf)
```

The management assistant can also ask other questions regarding the contract details during this stage. Also inform the management assistant if the contract dates have changed since the job offer. The management assistant will also contact the department secretary and HR advisor to check the contract details, after which an automatic flow of approval starts in MyHR.

If you have not heard of the MyHR process for more than a week, you can go to the management assistant to check where the process is currently stuck. They can see at which step action is required and by whom. Contact the person responsible for the current step to continue the process. 

Ultimately, the contract will be made in MyHR and the candidate has to sign it. Congratulations, the candidate is now officially hired!

**When the contract is signed**

When the contract has been signed, the candidate will automatically get emails for their NetID and campus card.

The visa are requested by the management assistant. A working permit for EU candidates usually takes ~4 weeks. A residence permit for non-EU candidates usually takes 12 weeks.  
<!-- Management assistants contact HR Services for the visa -->



## 4.2 First workday

The new employee will soon join the team. It is important to consider how you will structure their first day and the initial week. Ensure they receive a warm welcome, including an introduction to key colleagues and a visit to the management assistants. [This file](../../../PhDs/Appendices/supervisor_checklist.pdf) can be used as guide for the onboarding process.

During the first week, schedule a meeting to take place two weeks before the end of the trial period. This meeting will allow you to review the new employee’s performance. Use this opportunity to provide constructive feedback—highlighting strengths while identifying areas for improvement. If there are serious concerns regarding the employee’s performance, it is advisable to consult the HR Advisor a few weeks prior to the end of the trial period.

Lastly, please ensure that all documents related to the hiring process are deleted for privacy compliance.
