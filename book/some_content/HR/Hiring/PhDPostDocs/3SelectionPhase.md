# 3 Selection phase

![SelectionPhase](../PhDPostDocs/Appendices/3Selection.PNG)


## 3.1 Selection steps 

The main steps of the selection process are:

1. The CV check. In this step you reject the candidates who miss must-haves. You also comment on the other candidates. Discuss your thoughts and considerations with the selection committee. Contact the talent acquisition specialist or the HR advisor if no promising candidates have applied. 

2. Screening interviews. A screening by short phone or video calls may be a good in-between step before the job interviews. 

3. The full interviews. Here you check the social and scientific fit of the candidates. 

4. Choosing a candidate. In this stage you choose the preferred candidate. In this stage you rate candidates based on the criteria you defined, and you make reference calls. 


A great guide for these steps can be found in chapter 3 of [this document](../PhDPostDocs/Appendices/PhD%20Recruitment%20en%20Selection%20Guide%20V1.pdf). Although this document is written for PhD hiring, it is also very helpful for other functions. 

```{admonition} Knowledge safety check
:class: warning, dropdown
Be aware of the **knowledge safety check**! Candidates from or with connections to China, Russia, Belarus, Iran and North Korea should be checked. It is wise to start the knowledge safety check as soon as you have a shortlist of the 3-4 best candidates. How to do it? 

  * Send an email to HR with the candidate(s) name(s) to be checked and the number of the vacancy.  
  * HR will communicate with the safety knowledge department. HR will inform you about the outcome as soon as they have the result.  
  * This check takes approximately 2 weeks and may in extreme cases take up to 10 weeks. 
  * Do not inform the candidates about the knowledge safety check as this information is confidential. 
```


Some important notes: 
* The selection process is done using **Talentlink**. Instructions can be found in a [series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbWrpIaE6Ac&list=PLvaU1SY38TUVKbhgaSeaaKQhWeHsRUDiZ&index=1)
and in [quick reference charts](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/en/group/guest/-/recruitmentsysteem). Use this system as much as possible and do not store CVs or send CVs by mail. 

* Regarding the selection committee: the selection is done using the 4-eye principle, meaning you select together with at least one other person. This is done to avoid biased decisions and blind spots. Try to include a senior staff member and someone neutral, who doesnâ€™t have a vested interest in the hire.

* About the **job interviews**: 

  * The management assistants can help you planning the interviews.  
  * General outlines for job interviews are available for [educational](../PhDPostDocs/Appendices/JobInterview_HelpingFiles/SPV%20Education%20Questionaire%20-%2020221220.%20-final.docx), 
  [leadership](../PhDPostDocs/Appendices/JobInterview_HelpingFiles/SPV%20Leadership%20questionaire%2020221220%20-%20final.docx) and [research](../PhDPostDocs/Appendices/JobInterview_HelpingFiles/SPV%20Research%20Questionaire%2020221220%20-%20final.docx) functions.  
  * Candidates for the permanent staff can come to the Netherlands for full job interviews, contact the department secretary for information about the travel allowance, etc 


* Check the **English proficiency level (ETV)** of the candidates. An additional test is needed if PhD candidates are non-native speakers and have not followed their masters in English, see [this intranet page](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/en/-/english-language-skills-etv-for-phd-candidates?p_l_back_url=%2Fen%2Fgroup%2Fguest%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Detv) for PhD's and [this intranet page](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/en/-/itav-english-language-skills?p_l_back_url=%2Fen%2Fgroup%2Fguest%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Detv) for other scientific staff.


* Be aware that the process may take longer depending on the nationality of the candidate. The knowledge safety check usually takes 2 weeks and in extreme cases 10 weeks. Acquiring visa usually takes ~4 weeks for EU citizens and 12 weeks for non-EU citizens. 


## 3.2 Job offer 

When you have selected your preferred candidate and the Knowledge Safety Check is positive, you can inform the candidate and send a job offer. Make sure you do not reject your second-best or silver candidate(s) before the job offer is signed.  

First, you call the candidate with the good news. Collect the following details before calling the candidate: 

* Details about the contract, such as duration, starting date, salary, working hours and contact details for follow-up questions. You can revisit the Vacancy Format for details and contact the HR advisor if you have any questions regarding this. Planning the first workday in a holiday period is not preferred, but if you choose to do so please ensure someone will be there for the new employee during the first week. 

* Check the English proficiency level (ETV). At this stage, it is highly recommended to have either a good test result, an English masters degree or a native status by nationality. See also the intranet page [English language skills for PhD candidates](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/en/-/english-language-skills-etv-for-phd-candidates?p_l_back_url=%2Fen%2Fgroup%2Fguest%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Detv) or [English language skills for other scientific staff](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/en/-/itav-english-language-skills?p_l_back_url=%2Fen%2Fgroup%2Fguest%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Detv)

* If you are hiring an international candidate, provide the URL of the website of the Coming to Delft department and a brief introduction of their services.  

* If you are hiring a PhD, include a brief introduction to the Graduate School and the mentor programme. 

* Gather information about the next steps of the process: the job offer, the contract, the first workday. Preferably, you also provide the candidate with a time indication of the next steps. 

Next, you contact the management assistant for the job offer. The management assistant will make the job offer based on the information you provide: duration, starting date, salary, working hours, english proficiency (ETV) and contact details. The management assistant will send the job offer to the candidate with you in the cc. 

Do not forget to update Talentlink. When the job offer is accepted and all other candidates are rejected, contact the management assistant to close the vacancy in Talentlink.
