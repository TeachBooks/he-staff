# 1 Preparation phase

![Preparation phase](../PhDPostDocs/Appendices/1Preparation.PNG)

## 1.1 Financial and departmenal checks 

Before posting a vacancy, the internal project budget must be approved. This applies to all project-funded vacancies (second or third cash flow).

<!-- Later we can add a link in the paragraph above to the internal budget explanation -->

For first-time vacancy holders it is recommended to meet with both the Department Secretary to discuss the practicalities of the hiring process.

Once the financial check is complete, you may proceed to the next step



## 1.2 Fill in vacancy format 

Use the vacancy format for [PhDs](./Appendices/Vacancy%20format%20ENG%20-%20October%202024%20format%20PHD.docx) or [PostDocs](./Appendices/Vacancy%20format%20ENG%20-%20October%202024%20format%20POSTDOC.docx) to gather the required information for the vacancy. As some have noted, the format does not handle comments well, so you can consider making and shaping the vacancy text in a separate word document first. 


Some notes regarding the vacancy format:
* Standard contract details apply for these positions and are already filled in.
<!-- * The Talent Acquisition Specialist of the faculty is Avital Fishman. 
* The cash flow is 1 for direct employees and 2/3 for project employees. -->
* The vacancy text can be written using the vacancy writing guide. The guide and examples of vacancy texts are available [here](https://sharepoint.tudelft.nl/misc/medewerkersportaal/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/SitePages/HR%20Vacatureteksten.aspx).

* Some extra tips on formulating the requirements and using it in the selection strategy can be found in [this document](../PhDPostDocs/Appendices/7%20Tips%20for%20crafting%20a%20Selection%20Strategy.pdf) 
* The standard time for a vacancy posting to stay active is 4-6 weeks. Contact Dept-Chair-HE@tudelft.nl if you would like to deviate from this.  
* A reasonable start date will be six months from the moment you start the vacancy process. Please be aware that the visa arrangement and the safety check may take weeks for NON-EU candidates.

**Selection committee**

At this stage, it is advisable to establish the selection committee. For PhD and Postdoc positions, the four-eye principle is applied during the selection process. This requires at least one other person to participate in the selection, ensuring that decisions are impartial and free from bias. It is recommended to include a senior staff member as well as a neutral party who has no vested interest in the hiring decision.


## 1.3 Send vacancy format 

As soon as the financial check is done and the vacancy format is completed, you can send the vacancy form to secr-he-citg@tudelft.nl. The department secretary will check the vacancy and the vacancy format will then be sent to recruitment (Recruitment-CITG@tudelft.nl). The recruitment assistant will create the vacancy in the recruitmentsystem, after which you will receive an email to approve the vacancy.

After approval your vacancy will appear on: 

- TU Delft’s internal (intranet) vacancy page 
- TU Delft’s external vacancy page 
- Academic Transfer and Euraxess
- TU Delft’s LinkedIn job page
