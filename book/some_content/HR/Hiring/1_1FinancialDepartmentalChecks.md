## 1.1 Financial and departmenal checks 

First of all, there are two checks: 

* The financial check. If the vacancy is part of a project (2nd/3rd cashflow), the internal budget has to be checked. If the vacancy has a 1st cashflow, contact the Business Controller David Lodowica for the financial check. 
* The departmental check. Inform the department secretary and your section head about the vacancy you want to post. 

If this is your first time being a vacancy holder, also meet with the department secretary and the HR advisor to discuss the practicalities of the hiring process. 

If both checks are complete, you can continue with the next step.
