```{admonition} Knowledge safety check
:class: warning, dropdown

Candidates from or with connections to China, Russia, Belarus, Iran and North Korea should be checked. It is wise to start the knowledge safety check as soon as you have a shortlist of the 3-4 best candidates. How to do it? 

- Send an email to HR with the candidate(s) name(s) to be checked and the number of the vacancy. 

- HR will communicate with the safety knowledge department. HR will inform you about the outcome as soon as they have the result. 

- This check takes approximately 2 weeks and may in extreme cases take up to 10 weeks. 

- Do not inform the candidates about the knowledge safety check as this information is confidential. 
```

The selection process is done using **MyCareer**. Instructions can be found [on this intranet page](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/-/recruitment-system?p_l_back_url=%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Drecruitment). Use this system as much as possible and do not store CVs or send CVs by mail. 



## 3.1 CV Selection to longlist 

The selection process begins with a preselection, carried out by the committee chair and two additional members of the selection committee, also referred to as the "small committee." Utilize MyCareer to categorize candidates into "invite," "reject," and "doubt" groups. This stage results in the creation of a longlist of candidates, who will then proceed to online interviews.

Contact the talent acquisition specialist (A.Fishman@tudelft.nl) or the HR advisor (m.scheers-vanderhorst@tudelft.nl) if no promising candidates have applied. 

In cases where there are a large number of applicants, it is advisable to make an initial selection based on a single, essential criterion. Subsequently, you may apply the full scoring chart. Adhere strictly to the checklist and remain mindful of potential biases. For example, CV gaps may be interpreted negatively, leading to the rejection of candidates. However, it is important to consider that such gaps may have valid reasons.

Before scheduling the interviews, you may choose to do a 15-20 minute screening by phone or video call. This can provide additional insights, as some candidates may exceed expectations, while others may not. 

Rejected candidates must be informed within two weeks after the application deadline. Email templates for rejection are available in the recruitment system and can be sent by the management assistants. For later stages when candidates have been interviewed, the vacancy holder must personally communicate rejections via email or phone. Guidelines and tips can be found in *Paragraph 4.2*.



## 3.2 Online interviews to shortlist 

This intermediate step is useful when more than three candidates remain in the selection process. 

Consult with the small committee to identify the top four to five candidates. Conduct online interviews with these selected candidates. A proposed agenda can be found in [this document.](../HigherFunctions/Appendices/OnlineInterviewAgenda.docx) Also make reference calls.

```{admonition} Guidelines for reference calls
:class: tip, dropdown

Basic guidelines for a valuable reference call: 

-	Start by introducing yourself and state the purpose of your call. 
-	Confirm whether it’s a convenient time to talk. 
-	Briefly describe the position (field of expertise, core goals, most important techniques). 
-	Confirm the relationship between the referent and the candidate. 
-	Verify basic duties such as internship topics, products, duties and dates of assignments/ internships. 
-	Ask your project-specific questions about knowledge, skills and competencies (e.g., time management, technical experience, and content of theoretical or practical courses). 
-	Ask for examples when the reference offers an opinion. 
-	Be consistent. Ask the same questions about all final candidates and weigh the information equally; what disqualifies one should be the basis for disqualifying others.

Questions could include: 

-	What was the nature and length of your relationship with the candidate? 
-	Which duties and responsibilities were assigned to the candidate? 
-	Did they complete those duties satisfactorily? 
-	Did they go above and beyond what was required without being asked? 
-	What were the candidate’s strengths as an employee/intern/student? 
-	What would you consider as the ideal next step for this candidate? Why? 
-	Would you hire or want to work with the candidate again? Why? 
-	Why did they leave the position? (if applicable). 
-	Is there anything else I should take into consideration before I hire this candidate?

## 3.3 On campus selection 

The next step consists of the on campus interviews.  

Return to step *2.2 Prepare for the selection phase* to ensure all necessary preparations have been completed.

- Ensure that all members of the selection committee have the date marked in their calendars and have received the required documents, including the scoring chart and the schedule for the day. Additionally, have the template for the advice to the dean readily available. If necessary, print these documents.

- Inform the candidates about the on-campus interviews using the prepared email. Also, if you have not already done so, contact the candidates who were not selected following the online interviews. Guidance for conducting rejection conversations can be found in *Section 4.2: Reject Candidates*.

- Verify that all rooms have been booked, refreshments (coffee, tea) and lunch (if applicable) have been arranged, a host is available to greet the candidates, and students are present to attend the trial lectures.


After the selection day you send your advice to the dean. You can continue to the next phase once the dean has approved.
