# Hydraulic Engineering Staff Website

Welcome to your one-stop shop for information about the Hydraulic Engineering Department---for staff!

```{note}
The contents of this website will be filled in during May and June 2024. The current URL is temporary to facilitate our ability to share information with you as soon as possible. At a later moment the website will be moved to a permanent location on a TU Delft server, along with SSO login.

We chose the Jupyter Book/TeachBooks platform because it is very easy to update and modify the information being presented, and because it is being used extensively in education at CEG (e.g., [the MUDE book](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book)).

This book is created from the [TeachBooks Template Book](https://github.com/TeachBooks/template). Visit [teachbooks.tudelft.nl](https://teachbooks.tudelft.nl/) or contact Robert Lanzafame and Tom van Woudenberg at teachbooks@tudelft.nl if you would like more information.
