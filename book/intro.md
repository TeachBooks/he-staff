# Hydraulic Engineering Staff Page

**Welcome to the Hydraulic Engineering Staff Page**

![Landing page](/../figures/Campus-TUDelft-intro.jpg) 

This platform is intended to provide staff members of the Hydraulic Engineering department with practical information on a range of topics. It already provides information on departmental procedures, and will continue to be updated as new topics or documents become available.

Please note that this page may include personal information relevant to HE staff and is intended to make frequently needed information easier to find. However, it does *not* replace the official TU Delft intranet or its formal documentation.
All staff members are warmly invited to contribute. If you notice something is missing or have suggestions for improvement, please contact [webmaster-wbk-citg@tudelft.nl](mailto:webmaster-wbk-citg@tudelft.nl).
