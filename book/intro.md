**Information about the platform:** This webpage is built based on the Jupyter Book & TeachBooks platform because it is being used extensively in education at CEG (e.g., [the MUDE book](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book)) and it offers plenty of advantages. For instance, uploading and sharing documents, e.g. pdf's or image files, is fairly quick to update and maintain. Furthermore, it offers flexibility in building the desired structure with a low level of complexity.

**Credits:** This book is created from the [TeachBooks Template Book](https://github.com/TeachBooks/template). Visit [teachbooks.tudelft.nl](https://teachbooks.tudelft.nl/) or contact Robert Lanzafame and Tom van Woudenberg at teachbooks@tudelft.nl if you would like more information.
