# Grants and funding

The Marie Skłodowska-Curie Doctoral Network (MSCA-DN) programme under Horizon Europe is a highly regarded initiative that strengthens international collaboration and doctoral training. The VENI is part of the NWO Talent Programme and enables talented early-career researchers to develop their own research ideas during three years of independent work. 

Both these grants are of strategic importance and add to the visibility, as well as reputation of the department. To apply for these grants, some special rules apply. The full criteria can be found in the following documents. Below is a short summary of some of the most important criteria:

- Departmental criteria for VENI applications [download here (PDF)](./Appendices/Departmental_criteria_VENI.pdf)
- Departmental criteria for MSCA Doctoral Network (MSCA-DN) projects [download here (PDF)](./Appendices/Departmental_criteria_MSCA-DN.pdf)



## MSCA-DN

MSCA-DN projects have funding for three years, while in the Netherlands, PhD projects have a standard duration of four years. Before submission and recruitment, the full four years of funding must be secured. When this has been done, the regular project guidelines can be followed.

In very rare cases, a submission may be carried out before securing the full four years of funding. However, in these cases, researchers must request approval from the HE MT before being allowed to proceed. Approval may be given when there is a clear and credible plan to secure the missing funding. Please be aware that this procedure comes with personal and reputational risk.

## VENI

In the case of VENI grants, the number of yearly applications is limited. The faculty departments are required to screen proposals carefully before submission. Therefore, before being able to apply for this grant, the Hydraulic Engineering MT needs to approve the application. Department criteria for VENI projects include that the project needs to be strongly embedded in the department and must be covered by the VENI budget.
