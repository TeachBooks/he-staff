## Building Access

Regular access hours for staff are 07:00—20:00 on weekdays. Work outside these hours should remain the exception. That being said, temporary extensions can be granted when there is a clear operational need or if there are personal circumstances. Two levels of extended access are possible:


1. Up to 23:00 on weekdays (Monday–Friday), or

2. 24-hour access, including weekends.

Decisions on extended access are made by the section leader in consultation with the area coordinator. Area supervisors receive extended access as part of their role. Access rights can easily be activated or removed by the HE secretariat, allowing flexibility for short-term or one-off access.

The [TU Delft Working Alone policy](https://intranet.tudelft.nl/documents/d/guest/procedure_alleenwerken) is the guiding framework and will be used to evaluate whether a request can be granted. If extended access continues for several months or up to one year, it will be reviewed during the annual R&O discussion to confirm whether it remains necessary. Students and external visitors are not eligible.


**Procedure**

1. Submit written request with reason to your section leader, requested access type (until 23:00 or 24-hour), and expected duration.

2. The section leader will assess necessity against the TU Delft Working Alone Policy, consult the area coordinator, and take a decision (max. 1 year; shorter/one-off where possible)

3.	The secretariat can activate/deactivate card access in the ICT system (including temporary or single-event access)
