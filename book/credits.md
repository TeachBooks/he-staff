## How the book is made
<!-- edit $CI_PROJECT_NAME below accordingly -->
<!-- This book is created using open source tools: it is a Jupyter Book that is written using Markdown, Jupyter notebooks and Python files to generate some figures. The files are stored on a [public GitLab repository of TU Delft](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/interactivetextbooks-citg/$CI_PROJECT_NAME/). The published version of this book is compiled from a special branch (`he-staff`). View the repository README file or contact the author for additional information. -->

This webpage is built based on the Jupyter Book & TeachBooks platform because it is being used extensively in education at CEG (e.g., [the MUDE book](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book)) and it offers plenty of advantages. For instance, uploading and sharing documents, e.g. pdf's or image files, is fairly quick to update and maintain. Furthermore, it offers flexibility in building the desired structure with a low level of complexity.
